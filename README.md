# Rima Sharma — Portfolio

This repository works as my personal portfolio website, built using **Markdown and GitHub Pages**.

The site presents a curated overview of my professional work as a **Technical Writer and Editor**, including documentation samples, experience highlights, and resume information. It is intentionally content-first, lightweight, and easy to maintain using a docs-as-code approach.

## About the Site

- Built with **GitHub Pages (Jekyll)**
- Written primarily in **Markdown**
- Focused on clarity, structure, and readability
- Designed as a **portfolio**, not a documentation manual
