# Hi, I’m Rima

I'm a technical writer and editor based in Liverpool with 18 years of experience. My expertise lies in delivering accurate, concise, and user-friendly content in visually appealing formats. I've worked in corporate environments and as an independent freelancer. Transitioning to freelancing after 13 years in full-time technical writing roles strengthened my ability to manage projects autonomously and deliver high-quality results. I'm also a top-rated freelancer on Upwork with a 100% success rate.
